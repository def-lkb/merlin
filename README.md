Installing Merlin manually
==========================

Compilation
-----------

Needed: OCaml 4, ocamlfind, ocamlbuild, yojson, menhir

Merlin requires OCaml >=4.00.1 (may work with newer versions, but it is tightly
bound to compiler internals).  
Then ensures that "yojson" and "menhir" are installed and are registered in
ocamlfind.

    $ ./configure
    $ make


Installation
------------

If you don't get any error in step above:

    $ make install 

Installation from git
---------------------

Don't forget to checkout submodules after pulling/cloning:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

Installing Merlin with opam
===========================

Needed: [opam](http://opam.ocamlpro.com/doc/Advanced_Install.html),
OCaml 4.00.1 (can be installed via opam typing `opam switch 4.00.1`).

Then, just do :

    $ opam install merlin

Setting-up vim
==============

Makes sure that ocamlmerlin binary can be found in PATH.

The only setup needed is to have the following directories in
vim runtime path (append this to your .vimrc):

    :set rtp+=$SHARE_DIR/ocamlmerlin/vim
    :set rtp+=$SHARE_DIR/ocamlmerlin/vimbufsync

The default configuration can be seen in:  

    $SHARE_DIR/ocamlmerlin/vim/plugin/merlin.vim  

Now you may be interested by *Features and interaction with other plugins*,
*Merlin project* and *Extensions* sections.

Using Vundle
------------

Alternatively you can install vim support using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).
Add the following to your .vimrc

    Bundle 'def-lkb/merlin', {'rtp': 'vim/merlin/'}
    Bundle 'def-lkb/vimbufsync'

Features and interaction with other plugins
--------------------------------------------

Omnicompletion should be available out-of-box.

The documentation is accessible through `:h merlin.txt` and should provide all
the necessary information on how to set-up merlin with other plugins (
[Supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab), 
[neocomplcache](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache),
[syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)).
It also lists, and explain, all the available commands.

Misc: description of plugin's files
-----------------------------------

- $SHARE\_DIR/ocamlmerlin/vim -- main vim plugin directory
  - plugin/merlin.vim -- sample configuration
  - autoload/
    - merlin.vim   -- main vim script
    - merlin.py    -- helper script needed by merlin.vim
                      (has to be in the same directory)
  - syntax\_checkers/  
                      -- integration with syntastic (ocaml or omlet)  
                      -- set g:syntastic_ocaml_checkers = ['merlin']  
                      --  or g:syntastic_omlet_checkers = ['merlin']

- $SHARE\_DIR/ocamlmerlin/vimbufsync  
              -- library needed by merlin vim mode to keep buffer synchronized


Upgrading vim plugin from merlin 1.0
------------------------------------

Merlin plugin now relies on another vim helper called vimbufsync.
If you installed from opam and/or archive, just make sure that vimbufsync is in vim runtime path:

    :set rtp+=$SHARE_DIR/ocamlmerlin/vimbufsync

Emacs interface
===============

merlin comes with an emacs interface (file: emacs/merlin.el) that implements a
minor-mode that is supposed to be used on top of tuareg-mode.

To get it working you only to load the file `emacs/merlin.el' of the distribution.

If you installed through opam, a good thing to do is:

    
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.opam/4.00.1/share/emacs/site-lisp/")
    (require 'merlin)


To use it, you will need

- json.el (available by package.el)  
- auto-complete-mode (optional, available by package.el and the MELPA repository)

Once it is done, to enable merlin in a buffer, just type M-x merlin-mode. If you want merlin to be started on every ML buffer issue:

    (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'merlin-mode)


Features
--------

merlin implements a locked zone like proofgeneral to know what merlin knows of
the buffer. To advance or retract the locked zone to the point, use C-c C-RET.
Note that retraction can go before the point in case the point is not at the end
of the last definition. Lock zone is by default shown using a marker in the
margin of the last line of it. The behaviour is controlled by the variable
`merlin-display-lock-zone'.

Main keybindings:

- C-c l allows you to load a findlib package inside merlin. For a project you
should use a .merlin file

- C-c C-t will show you the type of the expression under point. The behaviour of
  this is quite complex. It will:

  - try to find the node of the typed AST the current point is in, and returns
    this type. Further call to C-c C-t allow to go up (or down with a prefix
    argument) in the AST

  - try to type the ident under point within the local environment

  - try to type the ident under point within the local environment.

  Moreover, C-u C-c C-t is used to type the region (if there is no selected AST
  node)

- C-c C-x goes to the next error

- C-c C-u refreshes merlin's cache (when you recompiled other files, might be
  handy)

- C-c C-r retracts the whole buffer (useful when merlin seems confused)

- C-c d will print the definition of the type of the expression underpoint if
  any. If the type is compliated (eg. 'a -> 'a option) it will print the definition  of the codomain

Moreover, you have regular auto-completion (M-TAB by default) using
completion-at-point. There is auto-complete integration you can enable
by setting merlin-use-auto-complete-mode to t:

    (setq merlin-use-auto-complete-mode t)

Merlin project
==============

When loading a ml file in your editor, merlin mode will search a file named
.merlin in the same directory or in parent directories.

The ".merlin" allows you to integrate merlin with your project.
Each line of this file begin with a command name followed by one argument:
- S \<src-dir\>: add a source directory, used to find \*.ml / \*.mli files
- B \<build-dir\>: add a build directory, used to find \*.cmi files
- PKG \<findlib-pkg\>: load a findlib package and its dependencies in merlin

Directory are either absolute or relative to the directory containing ".merlin"
file.

Extensions
==========

Merlin doesn't support (nor plan to support) Camlp4. However, a few common
extensions are hardcoded:

Lwt
---

Support for lwt, match\_lwt, try\_lwt / finally, for\_lwt, while\_lwt,
if\_lwt and raise\_lwt.  
You need to add lwt package (with ":Use lwt" or "PKG lwt" in .merlin) for
this to work, and it may be necessary to reload buffer for this change to
take effect.

type-conv
---------

A few syntax extensions based on type-conv are supported as well.
Namely :
- sexplib.syntax
- binprot.syntax
